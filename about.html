<p>To be plugged in is to be connected. Looking For the Plug connects young trendsetters to unique, high quality, small label goods. We are the bridge between boutique online retailers selling clothing, health products, and homegoods and the customers who make everything look cool.</p>
<p>We started this website specifically to meet the needs of folks who are seeking to not fit in. The people who donâ€™t want to shop at the regular department store, but they prefer curated items that are available to consumers on a limited basis.</p>
<p>Does this sound like you? If so, welcome to the plug!</p>
